            <p>
                In 2024, the United States experienced a wave of high-profile foodborne illness outbreaks, from the deadly 
                Listeria outbreak linked to Boar‚Äôs Head deli meats that claimed at least 10 lives to the widely covered McDonald‚Äôs 
                E. Coli outbreak that sickened hundreds. The number of food recalls and cases of certain foodborne illnesses has also 
                steadily grown in recent years.
            </p>
            <p>
                These findings have both experts and consumers seriously concerned about the safety of our food supply.
            </p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>
                    ‚ÄúThe food supply chain has grown longer and more intricate over the past few decades,‚Äù says Elaine Scallan Walter, 
                    Professor at the Colorado School of Public Health who researches the spread and impact of foodborne diseases. 
                    ‚ÄúWhile this has made food more available and affordable, every additional step in the process introduces new risks 
                    for contamination.‚Äù

                The dynamics of foodborne disease is also changing. Foods once considered to be safer are now leading causes of illness. Onions alone have been implicated in multiple outbreaks since 2020, resulting in over 2,300 cases of various diseases. While leafy greens like spinach and romaine lettuce, foods that anchor healthier diets, have also become leading culprits in foodborne outbreaks.
            </p>
            <blockquote>
            <p>
                ‚ÄúMore people are getting sick from foods that used to be considered low risk,‚Äù says Roni Neff, associate professor at 
                Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not just undercooked chicken. Foodborne illness can come from 
                a variety of sources, and we need to stay vigilant at every step.‚Äù
            </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
            Foodborne illness is a persistent global health threat. They happen when harmful pathogens (like bacteria, viruses or parasites) get into the food we eat. In the United States alone, they cause over 48 million cases of illness, 128,000 hospitalizations, and 3,000 deaths every year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). </p>

 <p>While foodborne diseases have existed throughout history, the recent outbreaks are hardly isolated incidents. Certain global conditions, both logistical and environmental, could be leading to more frequent and severe outbreak events. </p> 

 <p>According to Kristie L. Ebi,  professor of Environmental and Occupational Health Sciences at the University of Washington, climate change adds another layer of complexity and could be a major driver of this public health crisis.</p> 

<blockquote>
 <p>‚ÄúPathogens like E. coli and Salmonella thrive in warmer, wetter conditions,‚Äù explains Ebi. ‚ÄúAs global temperatures rise, we‚Äôre seeing shifts in how and where these pathogens proliferate, including longer seasons of contamination.‚Äù</p> 
</blockquote>
<p>A 2024 study 
published in the journal Applied and Environmental Microbiology supports Ebi‚Äôs hypothesis, finding that changing environmental conditions, such as increased humidity and altered plant health could increase the risk of Salmonella contamination in raw produce. Salmonella is the most common cause of foodborne hospitalizations and deaths in the US, causing over one million cases of sickness every year. </p>

<p>The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has also highlighted the increased risk of foodborne diseases as a direct consequence of climate change, predicting that the risk will likely increase in the coming decades without significant intervention being taken.</p>

<p>In response to these risks and outbreaks, food safety experts are urging an upgraded and multifaceted approach to prevention. Martin Wiedmann, a professor of Food Science and Safety at Cornell University, emphasizes the need for stronger food safety systems that account for changing environmental conditions.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>‚ÄúFrom farm to table, every step of the supply chain must adapt to the realities of a warming planet,‚Äù says Wiedmann. "Ensuring food safety in the face of climate change requires a comprehensive strategy that includes monitoring, regulation, and consumer education."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Wiedmann mentions technologies like ‚Äúadvanced genomic sequencing‚Äù to trace outbreaks and pinpoint contamination sources with greater precision. Farmers should also be encouraged to adopt sustainable practices that minimize contamination risks, such as buffer zones to prevent runoff from livestock areas. In the meantime however, public educational campaigns on safe food handling practices remain our best bet for prevention. ‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt keep relying on recalls. We have to shift the focus from reacting to outbreaks to preventing them,‚Äù says Wiedmann.</p>

<p>As the US and the world grapple with a changing climate and food safety landscape, it‚Äôs important to remember what the stakes are. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>‚ÄúMy daughter got deathly sick and was on antibiotics for weeks,‚Äù says Theresa Pratt, an Aurora, Colorado resident whose 8-year-old daughter was among those hospitalized in the McDonald‚Äôs outbreak. What began as a routine trip to the drive-thru ended in a race to the emergency room. ‚ÄúIt started as a stomach ache, but within hours, she was in excruciating pain. By the time we got to the ER, her kidneys were starting to shut down.‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The experience of families like the Pratts underscore the urgency and toll of this issue. As the food system faces new challenges, it will require action and a collective commitment from updating regulations to fighting climate change itself. As 2024 has shown, we can‚Äôt afford to take our food safety for granted.</p>
